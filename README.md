## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for checking out my front-end coding project.

## Project Description

This is an HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript project that I built for learning purpose. The goal for this project was to design a simple video player UI that runs in the browser. As a challenge for my front-end development skills, I decided to give it a theme switching neumorphic background, and also make it responsive on all devices. This video player web application has some of the basic or common functionalities/features of a real video player application including:

* play or pause video
* seek next or previous video
* an animated progress bar to track the current time of the video
* user can click on a particular position on the progress bar to fast forward the video or seek backwards
* select a video from the playlist
