## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for checking out my front-end coding project.

## Project Description

This is an HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript project that I built for learning purpose. The goal for this project was to design a simple customized video player UI that runs in the browser. As a challenge for my front-end development skills, I decided to give it a theme switching neumorphic background, and also make it responsive on all devices. This video player web application has some of the basic or common functionalities/features of a real video player application including:

* play or pause video
* seek next or previous video
* an animated progress bar to track the current time of the video
* user can click on a particular position on the progress bar to fast forward the video or seek backwards
* select a video from the playlist

Again, this video player UI only runs in the browser and does not have all the features/functionalities expected from a real video player application. It's meant to be a demonstration of how to design a customized video player Interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.

## Demo

A demo of how the application looks is provided in the screenshot below. Or you can check it out at [press-play.netlify.app](https://press-play.netlify.app/)

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

## Limitation of this project

As stated before, this video player does not have all the features expected from an advanced video player application. Below are some of the features that were not included in the project:

* volume control
* add video to playlist from your local disk
* remove video from playlist
* create a new playlist etc...

I intend to add some of these features in future project when I create a fully functioning media (audio and video) player desktop application with JavaScript. And that will be anytime soon !!!!!!

#### Thanks and have a good day ðŸ‘‹
